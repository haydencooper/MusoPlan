# VCS Usage Report

## Development Challenges

Installing and integrating Git into my development workflow has been a relatively simple experience. The majority of the developmental challenges and disruptions came from 'learning to remember' and missing timings on adding or committing files. Once I built up my habits, it became second nature to add files to Git as soon as I created them or commit them whenever I completed/update a singular function.

Another challenge was researching how to pull files onto a different device to work seperately but keep development synced, though finding a solution and creating a seamless workflow did not take very long.

## Organisational Compliance

I maintained following the organisational requirements for distributed Version Control System by doing my due diligence in researching which Version Control System to implement moving forward. As mentioned within the requirements, it needed to be familiar and have well-developed ecosystems and support.

Once I had decided that Git was the VCS of choice, I configured my Git VCS to globally use my name and email address. I created a new repository named MusoPlan and a separate branch named feature to keep development separate from the final implementation. I committed my changes as frequently as possible and whenever I felt I had completed a logical unit of work to avoid making unrelated changes before committing.

I followed the industry standard when committing to the project repository, keeping messages within single change scope, in the present tense and imperative mood.

I created each repository and/or branch fresh with no previous code and only the README.md file present. All development was committed to a feature/development branch and then pushed onto the final/main branch once completed and tested.

## VCS Verification

I verified that Git VCS was performing correctly and as expected by correlating any commands I input through the terminal with the website. As an example, after I would commit a single function, I would check that my commit was pushed to the website and was correct. This process also applied when creating new branches or pulling the project from my feature branch onto a new device to work remotely.

I also used the commands git log and git status to verify that Git was committing and working as expected.

## Forking the Repository

In the case that I have copied/forked my repository from another repository, I would simply create a pull request so that my changes and/or developed app can be integrated into the central repository.
